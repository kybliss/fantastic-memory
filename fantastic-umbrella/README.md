# E-commerce Back End Starter Code

# Description

This is backend for an e-commerce service that I've written to be compatible with the assigned starter code. It can be run on port 3001 with the terminal command "npm start".

# Credits

The backend was written by me, Kyle Oros, with assistance from an edX bootcamp tutor. I referred to resources from the UCI bootcamp instructionals for guidance.
